### How did Ivan the Inspector start?

Ivan the Inspector is a two-man operation consisting of Ivan 
and his producer and cameraman Chris. The two were coworkers 
in 2021 when Chris had an idea to make a kids' show to rival 
the big names out there. At the time, his kids were 2 
and 4, and he had lots of kids' YouTube on and decided that 
we could do it better. From the outset, they wanted to be 
a channel that was more educational, less annoying for 
parents, and had better video quality.

### Is this a full-time job?

No, both Chris and Ivan do this part-time. Chris is a pastor 
and freelance videographer for his day job, and Ivan is a Software Engineer.
