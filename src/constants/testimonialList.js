      "We found you on YouTube when looking for leaf blower videos for toddlers.  Sean has been hooked on Ivan ever since!  He even repeats whole episodes during his play time ('this is my backpack leaf blower! It needs some gas')",

    review:
      "My husband and I love the format and appreciate all of the work you put in making your own graphics and songs and keeping things at a slow natural pace, similar to what they'd get if you were sitting with them in real life.  There are very few channels out there like yours - keep up the great work!",
